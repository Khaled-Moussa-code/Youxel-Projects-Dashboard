# KPI Weights Configuration
# Defines the weights used in composite KPI calculation
# Formula: KPI = (Performance Rate × W1) + (Utilization × W2) + (Done Tasks % × W3)
# All weights must sum to 1.0

# Default weights applied to all staff and teams
default_weights:
  performance_rate: 0.2  # How accurately work was estimated
  utilization: 0.1       # How fully capacity was used
  done_tasks: 0.7        # Percentage of tasks completed

# Team-specific weights (optional)
# Use this to apply different weights to specific teams
# Uncomment and customize as needed:
# 
# team_specific_weights:
#   Design:
#     performance_rate: 0.3  # Design team values estimation accuracy more
#     utilization: 0.2
#     done_tasks: 0.5
#   
#   Testing:
#     performance_rate: 0.1  # Testing team focuses more on completion
#     utilization: 0.1
#     done_tasks: 0.8
