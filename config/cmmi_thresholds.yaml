# CMMI Measures Thresholds Configuration
# Defines target values and thresholds for CMMI analysis

# Completion Rate: Actual SP / Planned SP
completion_rate:
  target: 0.90                # 90% - Minimum acceptable
  threshold_green: 0.90       # >= 90% is good
  threshold_yellow: 0.80      # 80-90% needs attention
  # < 80% is critical
